.SH "INPUT FILE FORMAT"
The
.B pstate
program expects an input file on the 
.B hxml
format. These files are produced from 
.B vsyml
output files using the
.B haskell-xml.xsl
filter script. The command format is
.IP
.B xsltproc (some_path)/haskell-xml.xsl vsymfile.xml pstatefile.hxml
.PP
where you should change the path and filenames to your needs. You can
also add an alias such as
.IP
.B alias hxmlify='xsltproc ~/scripts/haskell-xml.xsl'
.SH "SEE ALSO"
The full documentation for
.B pstate
is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the
.B info
and
.B pstate
programs are properly installed at your site, the command
.IP
.B info pstate
.PP
should give you access to the complete manual.
